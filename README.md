# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-WeRateDogs-Project
Wrangling, Analysis and Visualization of Data ---- Udacity Data Analyst Project

## Project Overview
### Introduction
> This project was part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program's data wrangling segment and is mostly focused on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python, as documented in the Jupyter Notebook. This Twitter account ranks pets while providing hilarious remarks. The rating denominator is often ten, although the numerators are typically more than ten.  Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 6 million followers and has received international media coverage.

> WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

## What kind of software do I require?

On your PC, you must be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook. The following libraries (packages) must be installed.These packages may be installed using conda or pip. Package installation instructions may be found in our Anaconda tutorial from earlier in the Nanodegree program.
- pandas
- NumPy
- requests
- tweepy
- json

## Project Specifications
### Code Functionality and Readability
All of the project's code is included in wrangle act.oluwatosin.ipynb, a Jupyter Notebook that runs without problems. The logical framework of the Jupyter Notebook is obvious and simple to understand. The code makes good use of comments and includes Jupyter Notebook Markdown cells. The phases of the data wrangling process (collect, evaluate, clean) are also clearly marked using comments or Markdown cells.

### Gathering Data

Data is gathered:
- From at least the three (3) different sources on the Project Details page.
- In at least the three (3) different file formats on the Project Details page.

### Assessing Data

There are two sorts of evaluations used:

- Visual assessment: For visual evaluation, each item of acquired data is shown in the Jupyter Notebook. Data can also be evaluated in an external program once it has been shown (e.g. Excel, text editor).
- Programmatic assessment: pandas' functions and/or methods are used to assess the data.
 
At least eight (8) data quality concerns and two (2) tidiness issues have been identified, which include issues that must be resolved in order to meet the Project Motivation. Each problem is described in one to a few phrases. 

### Cleaning Data

- The define, code, and test steps of the cleaning process are clearly documented.
- Copies of the original pieces of data are made prior to cleaning.
- All issues identified in the assess phase are successfully cleaned using Python and pandas.
- A tidy master dataset with all pieces of gathered data is created.

### Storing and Acting on Wrangled Data

- Save master dataset to a CSV file.
- The master dataset is examined in the Jupyter Notebook using pandas, and at least three (3) distinct insights are generated.
- Using Python's plotting packages, at least one (1) labeled visualization is created in the Jupyter Notebook. 

### Report

There are two reports:

- The wrangling efforts are summarized in the wrangle report.pdf document.
- In act report.pdf, the student communicates three (3) or more insights, including visualization.
