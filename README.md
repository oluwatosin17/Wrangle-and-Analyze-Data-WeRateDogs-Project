# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data-WeRateDogs-Project
Wrangling, Analysis and Visualization of Data ---- Udacity Data Analyst Project

## Introduction
> This project was part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program's data wrangling segment and is mostly focused on wrangling data from the WeRateDogs Twitter account using Python, as documented in the Jupyter Notebook. This Twitter account ranks pets while providing hilarious remarks. The rating denominator is often ten, although the numerators are typically more than ten.
